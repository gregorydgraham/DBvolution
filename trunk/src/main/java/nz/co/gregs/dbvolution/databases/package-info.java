/**
 * DBDatabase Subclasses That Connect to Specific Supported Databases.
 * <p>
 * DBvolution removes Object/Relational Impedance by using classes to represent
 * and store the information on each table, and using special datatypes to make
 * setting query conditions trivial and intuitive.
 * <p>
 * To use DBV, first create a connection to your database using the DBDatabase
 * subclasses in {@link nz.co.gregs.dbvolution.databases}.
 * <p>
 * DBDatabase sub-classes that include all the tweaks required to make
 * DBvolution work perfectly on the supported databases.
 * <p>
 * Most databases will work for most of DBvolution without any changes but I
 * don't ship them until they pass 100% of the tests.
 * <p>
 * I've been writing SQL for 20 years and DBV is easier, I hope you like it.
 * <p>
