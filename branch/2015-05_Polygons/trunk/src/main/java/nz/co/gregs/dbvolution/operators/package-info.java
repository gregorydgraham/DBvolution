/**
 * The Operators Used By QueryableDatatypes To Provide The Most Common
 * Conditions.
 * <p>
 * Operators are used internally by QueryableDatatypes, you shouldn't need them
 * directly.
 * <p>
 * They are also a little old compared to
 * {@link nz.co.gregs.dbvolution.expressions}
 * <p>
 * I've been writing SQL for 20 years and DBV is easier, I hope you like it.
