The java.lang.reflection.Proxy approach can only work on interfaces,
and DBv mainly works on concrete classes, so it won't help us at all.
The solution is to use CGLIB, like Mockito and so many other libraries.

For the moment, we'll just use the java.lang.reflection.Proxy approach and interfaces
so that we can test the idea as a whole.
