/**
 * Specific Exceptions For Specific Errors.
 * <p>
 * One of the big problems with JDBC is the refusal by vendors to sub-class
 * SQLException, which prevents any programmer from automatically coping with
 * common problems.
 *
 * <p>
 * I believe that exceptions are meant to help the programmer not punish them.
 * So here are all the exceptions and the include helpful names and messages.
 * <p>
 * I've been writing SQL for 20 years and DBV is easier, I hope you like it.
