 * DBvolution Equivalents For The Standard Java and Database Types.
 * <p>
 * QueryableDatatypes like DBString, DBLargeText, and DBInteger make querying
 * trivial.
 * <p>
 * All the permitted methods are included in the object and type-safety prevent
 * embarrassing errors.
 * <p>
 * I've been writing SQL for 20 years and DBV is easier, I hope you like it.
